Among the things I accomplished at this company was working with JSF, a Java-based technology that enables UI interactions. It uses XHTML for creating templates, to which some of the language's own components are added. Among the Java libraries I learned during this experience were JasperReports and PrimeFaces as a visual framework. In addition, I had the opportunity to meet highly skilled people in Oracle database management, where I learned to create complex queries and stored procedures.

At this company, I learned that errors should not be ignored, and what seems like strange behavior can become a major problem.
