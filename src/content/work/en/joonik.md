At this company, I took my first steps in end-to-end test automation with Selenium. My role was more front-end oriented, and among the things I accomplished were a website with Jekyll, several WordPress sites, and an online store with PrestaShop.

One of the things I value most about this company is its focus on doing things, then doing them well, and then doing them even better.

The most important lesson I learned is the phrase: "Don't assume. When you assume, is likely saying ass you, me"
