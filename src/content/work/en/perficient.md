I consider this company the place where my professional career took a turn toward testing.

Here I have learned a lot about testing strategies, soft skills, test automation, and much more.

From this experience, I highlight the opportunity to create my own career path and move from developer to Quality Assurance (SDET is a branch of QA that requires technical knowledge in development).
And I learned the importance of developing good tests for an application and what is required to determine whether an application meets or fails to meet customer expectations, as well as the importance of communication for effective teams.
