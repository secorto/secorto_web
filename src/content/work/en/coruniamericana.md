This was my first work experience, through the university's job placement program.
In this experience, I learned to set up proxy servers, configure Linux machines, perform server maintenance, set up web servers, and use PHP.

At the university, I participated in a research group and learned about research methodologies and structuring research projects. With the university's research group, we participated in a national conference of research groups where we presented a project about the game "La Cuarta." The featured photo is from when I was at the hotel before presenting the project at the national conference held in Montería, Colombia.
