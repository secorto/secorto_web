Translated in November 2025

While it's known that closed systems don't offer many modification options, the software is as it comes, and modifying it could violate the terms established by the developers.

Closed-source software is a good option for those who are used to it and have the money to pay for the original license.

Furthermore, it's not fair to resort to installing cracks of dubious origin, putting both our computer and our data at risk.

I believe the best option is the one we are willing to pay for and respect, because closed-source software isn't inherently bad; it's just that when you pay for a restrictive license, you are accepting the terms it establishes.

I think it's a waste of time to desperately try to install something we're not allowed to.

Furthermore, if we have a basic version of it, there's no need to go to extremes to get the features of a more advanced version, as we would still be violating its license.

We must avoid becoming part of the chain of illegality, because we can then reach a state of complacency where we think that what we can do can only be done with that specific tool.

We should also avoid teaching or learning to use only one tool; we can teach alternatives so that developers get their act together, seeing that competition exists, and we prevent them from stagnating. If we don't want to follow these licenses, let's leave this software aside, respect the developers, and respect ourselves; let's not do anything illegal.

If we want, we can also embrace the philosophy of free software, because when we are free, we can:

- Use the software
- Modify the software
- Share the software
- Modify and share the modified software

Note: The fact that it is free software does not mean it is free of charge; what makes it free is the ability to share it if we want or not.

There is a large amount of free software offered by the community that develops it.

Free software is not just for programmers and designers; free software is for everyone.

There is free software for all tastes:

- From those who like it easy to those who like it difficult
- From those who like to know what's going on to those who don't care
- From those who want something very beautiful to those who want something primarily functional
