The Barranquilla Python community has been an excellent opportunity for personal growth. I've learned a great deal from them, and the clearest evidence of this is that my current work focuses on Python test automation. Undoubtedly, belonging to a developer community gives you the opportunity to interact with diverse people, enriching your personal experience. But it's not just a learning opportunity; it's a continuous exchange of knowledge among its members. Furthermore, contributing to open-source projects is a learning opportunity, and more than that, it allows you to apply your skills to projects that help solve people's problems.

Today, I'm proud to be part of the organizing team, a role in which I'm developing my communication skills.

Among other things, I've been able to participate in a national event called PyCon, organized by the Python community. In Colombia, it takes place annually on the second weekend of February, and I've had the opportunity to assist with logistics in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
