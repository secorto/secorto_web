On this website that you are visiting I share my experiences and knowledge either in Testing or Development. In my [blog] (blog) there are very interesting articles on different topics, among these the content of some of the talks that I have shared with the different communities in which I participate, and you can see its source code in [GitHub] (https://github.com/scot3004/secorto_web).

For the implementation of this site I decided to use the Jamstack architecture pattern, after performing several concept tests with different frameworks. Among them, WordPress, Jekyll, Lektor, Bolt and Gatsby, I discovered that Jamstack allows you to have a website with exceptional performance, easy to maintain where the APIs are separated from the front, although in particular on this site the content is flat files, saving me maintaining a backend running.

As for the management of this project, I do it through [ISSUES in GitHUB] (https://github.com/scot3004/secorto_web/issues), and for the design of the same use [Figma] (https://www.figma.com/file/osrbvexoaap04Twnf6ez/secorto-web). The continuous integration that is executed every time you sent the changes through [git] (https://git-scm.com/) In this execution the unit tests are run in [github actions] (https://github.com/features/actions) and the deployment of the website on [Netlify] (https://www.netlify.com/).

If you have any idea of ​​how I can improve this website, you can share it with me through [this discussion space] (https://github.com/scot3004/secorto_web/discussions), I will thank you a lot, and if you ask me if it is worth maintaining a personal website being a systems engineer I can assure you that it has earned you every second that I have invested.
