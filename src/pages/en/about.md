I'm Sergio Carlos Orozco Torres. I was born in Barranquilla, Atlántico on April 30, 1991.

In my school days I was very fond of spending time in libraries, and my favorite subject was computer science, although at that time I damaged some of the computers at home after several attempts I could fix them, because of this I studied Systems Engineering, in addition to a Specialization in Computer Security at the [Corporación Universitaria Americana](/en/trabajo/coruniamericana/).

Before finishing university I started working in software development within the same university where I studied and after graduating I followed this line of work, then I got a vacancy at [Informática y tributos](/en/trabajo/infortributos/) My contributions were mostly in the presentation of information about the software we developed, although at this time I saw the first talks about Python in the [Python Barranquilla](/en/comunidad/pybaq), I decided to bet on front-end development in a digital agency called [Joonik](/trabajo/joonik/) where I made my first test automation with selenium.
And in 2018 a year full of changes, I graduated, changed jobs to [Perficient](/en/trabajo/perficient/) where I have been working in software quality for 6 years and decided to move to Medellín, Antioquia.

I love software development so much that I participate in various software communities and wanted to create my own [web portfolio](/en/proyecto/scot3004) (this website) and you can see my [talks](/en/charla) in they're in Spanish.

I really like riding my bike and I managed to go from Barranquilla to Cartagena, Santa Marta and other nearby municipalities, and today that I live in Itagüí I continue riding my bike.

I also like to play video games, my favorites are open world ones, including the Assassins Creeds saga, Genshin Impact or the GTA saga (Grand Theft Auto).
